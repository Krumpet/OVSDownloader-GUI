# OVSDownloader-GUI
A program to automate downloading video files from the Old Technion Video Server.

Instructions:

0. Download OVSDownloader-GUI.exe, msdl.exe, and cygwin1.dll, they all need to be in the same folder
1. Run OVSDownloader-GUI.exe, Log in the browser window using the same credentials as for Moodle
2. Choose download folder with the 'Select Folder' button - note that you should use a relatively short path and without Hebrew characters,
This is a limitation on MSDL's part, not mine
3. Click on the course you want to download videos of, you should be in the page with the list of videos
4. Choose start and end video numbers, e.g. 5 & 7 to download videos 5, 6, 7
5. Click 'Let's Go!!!', file name and progress should appear in the text boxes

In case of any errors, it would be better to restart the program than to try in the same window.
